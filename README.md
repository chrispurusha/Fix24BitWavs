# Fix24BitWavs
Script to modify 24 bit wavs, allowing them to work on a Pioneer DJ deck

Note - you'll need a bit of know-how on how to run scripts in the MacOS terminal.
The line: d="/Volumes/ext-ssd2", will need modifying to point to the directory holding your files.

To execute, cd to directory containing the script and do: . ./Fix24BitWavs

Note the 2 dots in the command.
